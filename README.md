# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Ensemble-Learning-Model
### Introduction 
According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people. About 47% have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.

### Methodology 
This model predicts whether the person has chances of suffering a heart attack or not. It uses Ensemble Learning Approach for its prediction.

### Bagging 
Bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregation, is the ensemble learning method that is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset. In bagging, a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacementâ€”meaning that the individual data points can be chosen more than once.

### Voting 
A Voting Classifier is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models and predicts an output (class) based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.
Various Classification algorithms are used for this such as - 
K-Nearest Neighbour
LogisticRegression
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

### Results 
The model performed very well on training data with the accuracy score of 98%.
It predicted with the accuracy score of 96% on Testing Data.
